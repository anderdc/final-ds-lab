{"prompt": "what's up everyone welcome to the collin and samir show i'm samir i'm colin and every week on this channel we talk about the latest in the world of creators so if that interests you make sure to subscribe after we put out our breakdown video about our time with mr beast a lot of people in the comments were asking for the full interview this is the longest episode on our channel but for us experiencing 72 hours with jimmy was so educational and we pulled so much value from just being with him i feel like spending the time to watch this full interview can really teach you a lot about mr beast and just a lot about the career of being a creator this episode of the collin and smear show is brought to you by jelly smack if you want to check them out the link is in the description but more on them later in this episode colin roll the intro [music] all right so i have a question for you if can you describe to everyone watching where we are right now", "completion": "i'm burnt down screw this all we need is 20 million dollars hey netflix how much would you pay me yeah we're in 2d every other day we'd have mental breakdowns you're funny you want a job just put this out there i did not enjoy being here so i make videos"}
{"prompt": "how much how much did this cost and how long in the making has this been", "completion": "yes so uh i got a mic on so i can move around yeah yeah i just bought this brand new studio and a hundred acres of land around it and this is where we're filming all our videos going not all but all our indoor shoots going forward i mean ask me more questions there's so much to talk about it's"}
{"prompt": "you obviously you started in your bedroom right at the cost of zero", "completion": "so the land around it obviously the studio the renovations and everything and obviously we don't pay it all up front but in total it'll cost over 10 million dollars but it's probably not a good way to start it because like there's so much explanation people it seems excessive why would you just buy this you know what i mean like the reason we bought this is because of you know it's i've spent the entire day explaining to we had office and a bigger office than a studio a bigger studio than a third studio and then like and now it's consolidating and it's like if i just it's a weird way to start it because now it just sounds like i'm being expensive and lavish for no reason when there's a strategic reason why you know what i mean yeah i mean"}
{"prompt": "not only are we here in your you know brand new studio but we're here in your hometown and i think that's been one of the most interesting things to experience is spending a day with you here you've been spending time with your mom even some of the places in texas that's a fun sentence but even spending time uh here in your hometown like we've met people who grew up with you yeah which is really interesting like everyone asks us like i think people know that we're from out of town so like hey what are you guys doing here yeah we go we're filming you know some content they're like oh with mr beast yeah they're like oh i played baseball with him uh and it's really interesting to meet people and recognize like you are still in your hometown and a lot of people who are from small towns in in the us uh they think like i gotta get out of this town to find success so why did you stay in this town and how do you think you found success staying here", "completion": "exactly but still i'd rather i'd love to work our way up not just going hey look at this because now i just seem like some dumb rich youtuber yeah yeah so"}
{"prompt": "did it ever cross your mind though that maybe you're missing out on opportunity to collaborate like", "completion": "honestly it really was easier to just stay here you know as i started making the videos bigger and bigger and hiring people and i got warehouses and studios like you get so anchored down like oh you're just gonna relocate all your employees to la and buy a studio space there that cost 10 times more why you know like what what are the negatives of being in a small town i would argue with the internet and things like zoom where you can talk to everyone and we're so interconnected like there really is no need to pay 12 more tax because of what is it state tax in california and then on top of that pay like three to five times more for rent and and all this other stuff it's kind of it's almost silly to be there in our position"}
{"prompt": "not really never no i mean if you're good enough friends with someone they'll come down like you guys came down here yeah if there's someone i really want to hang out with like yeah or i could just fly there when i need to that plug is going to annoy me it's dead now um thank you thank you for getting rid of it but you know like if i really want to hang out with someone they can just come down you know i mean it's like a four-hour flight s:yeah i actually think on the inverse spending the day with you and like shadowing what at least half a day looks like i don't even think we saw your full day we we met up with you in the middle of the day that's true yeah and it was like boom boom boom we were going like thing to thing the thing and i think what i realized was being somewhere like this the positives actually outweigh the negatives so much and that there's so much focus okay and you are like you're really moving from thing to thing to thing like i think we watched you workshop about four videos in such a short amount of time", "completion": "yeah"}
{"prompt": "and that i thought was one of the most interesting things and just sitting there in those meetings understanding how you're thinking about what needs to happen and then additionally having the facilities and the team members who are ready to custom make things for the stories like i don't know if people realize i didn't realize and i've been watching your videos i've talked to you we've interviewed you i didn't realize that every set is like custom built for the video based app to come yeah but i mean you would think that okay let's reuse that or let's you know we could let's see how many videos we can film in this set", "completion": "gotcha"}
{"prompt": "but you know what i mean like it's just like it's part of the story so you started in your bedroom", "completion": "yep"}
{"prompt": "so you give away millions of dollars now five hundred thousand dollars at a time like large sums of money but when you first started giving away five thousand or ten thousand it's first started with the hundred dollars literally like even less than that like donating like ten bucks to twitch streamers and stuff like that but like the first real irl one i would order a pizza and i'd tip 100 bucks i think i did like three in that video so it's like 300 but when it gets to 10 000 that's when i think the people and i would imagine people around you like your mom are probably like jimmy what are you sure about that exactly like what was her reaction to that", "completion": "at what point did you start re like investing into the videos at a different scale great question b:literally put on me the entire time when i used to make like a dollar a day i saved up for months and i bought a microphone way worse than this microphone and then i saved up for like half a year and i bought a computer i and i the whole time i was like recording on my iphone so i was recording and editing on my iphone uh when i first started and then i got a microphone you could plug in i got a computer to edit on and then after like two years of just filming on my phone i had a hundred plus thousand subscribers but i still didn't have a camera because those things cost like a thousand bucks or i was stupid i didn't realize you could buy like g7x for 400 um so then i bought a camera and after that i bought monitors for my computer and i just kept going and reinvesting and then i took pizza delivery people 100 bucks and then i tipped a homeless man 10 grand and then you know gave away cars gave away houses and last 10 take take hand off a million dollars keeps in basically the entire time so like for the last like eight or nine years like every dollar i've made i just spent it the next month on content and i just did that every single month and it just kept getting bigger and bigger and here we are"}
{"prompt": "yeah how did you know that you know giving away a hundred bucks i guess it's natural but like why why does it make such good content like", "completion": "well so i i did my first brand deal i'm sure you guys have heard the story but for people that know i uh i was offered five grand for a video but this is when i was like 19. and there's so much money it's like mom look look and uh i i was like double it and i'll walk outside i'll give it to a homeless person and they're like no you won't that's like double it and i like pacing around my neighborhood for three hours convincing this guy like on the phone just double the money i promise the video will go viral and i'll give it to homeless friends i was like ten thousand dollars just looks better in a title it'll get more views i promise your your app will do better and i ended up getting ten thousand dollars and then gave it away and my mom's like why don't you just give away eight thousand dollars nine thousand why all ten thousand i was like mom it'll look better at the title and it's just better you know and um that's basically that"}
{"prompt": "were there other people when you were growing up making youtube videos", "completion": "well itâ€™s just one of those things is something i've always enjoyed like even when i was i wanna say poor i don't wanna over dramatize my story like you know we weren't ever the poor but i didn't have as much money if i saw homeless person i would you know open my wallet and give them almost all the money i had it's just fun you know because then you see the reaction their face light up stuff like that and so it kind of was just something i always enjoyed because there were so much easier ways to get views back then than like having to give away money and less stressful stuff but i just enjoyed it and i thought it was interesting to see people's reactions and like to try to like they're expecting a dollar and you give them 100 and they're like oh my god you know yeah um so it's kind of like a mixture of what i thought was interesting but also what i enjoy if that makes sense"}
{"prompt": "what's interesting is i went back and i you know i i did this a while ago but i did it recently again where i go to oldest uploaded videos on your channel you have some videos that are actually kind of similar to the videos we make where you were talking about other creators and how they were growing back", "completion": "around me no no no that was the biggest problem is i thought it was a freak of nature cause like people would tell me all you do is talk about youtube you're too obsessed with youtube like get a life like from 13 to like 19. i never met anyone who cared about youtube like not even outs and so i was so untalkative people thought like there was problems with me because i just wouldn't talk to anyone because all i would do is talk about youtube and after a while like you realize no one cares like you just get labeled as the guy that just only likes youtube and and so i kind of just like didn't talk at all and then when i was 19 and i had like 10 000 subscribers maybe it was like 18. and that's when i started meeting a few other youtubers online and i realized like i'm not a freak i'm just like obsessed with youtube and that's okay you know you just got to find other people that are like that most people want to talk about south park when you're younger or when i was younger or cartoons or whatever and i back then was figuring out how to drop ship or how to better edit a video or stuff like that like bring that up about a high school lunch table well i guess now people can bring that up at a high school lunch table 10 years ago and see what they say they're like what the you talking about"}
{"prompt": "so you would play call of duty and then you would talk about yeah other creators i thought that was really interesting", "completion": "when i did call of duty commentaries yeah yeah"}
{"prompt": "and some of those like you were uploading minecraft videos called duty videos did you have like a community when you first started uploading like did you notice people in the comments that were the same people", "completion": "studied so hardcore like there's i don't remember the youtuber's name but some youtubers uh ad revenue he was hacked and it was leaked and it showed that he did made like 300 grand over three years and i made like two videos on that and i was just so shocked i was like guys and i remember like telling everyone i know and they're all like who cares i was like guys youtubers can make money i thought it was just cool to be did you know they could make money i'm like a stupid teenager like really young i was like how is this possible i was like that's so much money that's more than like my mom makes you know in like so many years and i was i was mind blown by it and like i would find stuff like that and just make videos on it because i thought it was cool"}
{"prompt": "what type of content did you start feeling like okay now there's a like consistent subscriber base coming back to watch these videos", "completion": "not really there's like maybe like two or three people that would comment on each and back then which i think small youtubers should do is i would reply to every single comment and so i think a few people caught on that they would all i would always reply and so some people would just be like i wonder how long it'll take for him to reply and like so that was a lot of my comments when i was smaller but at least it kept him coming back and it's like it got to the point though i was getting hundreds a day and i was like okay like maybe i shouldn't spend an hour a day doing comments and so i dialed it back"}
{"prompt": "yeah it seems like sports is probably the most accepted thing here everywhere you drive it's like a baseball field there's basketball court soccer yeah we met someone today and they said they played baseball with you and then they also said that chandler was really good at basketball yeah", "completion": "that's a it's a hard one that one i i honestly have no idea like because so long ago it's all like a blur like i just remember like making videos and i remember being like dang like everyone's telling me like you're stupid you know you're very awkward like you know how why would you make it there's millions of people trying and i just remember being like i don't know i just like it i'm going to do this or i'm going to die trying kind of things also i was a really a big back then but i just after just grinding year after year there's probably some blur between when i was 17 18 19 somewhere in there it just started to get a little bit of views you know what i mean"}
{"prompt": "yeah so maybe we'll have to take him on next because tonight yeah we'll take him on like yeah i mean that looks good the footage isn't gonna show but i'll just show one clip from the basketball", "completion": "that's good"}
{"prompt": "okay okay four by the way yeah", "completion": "yeah we played basketball last night yeah and i think they scored like two points"}
{"prompt": "also i just want to say that i had a steal before the basket that's why i had the assist", "completion": "it finished ten four ten four times it was me and sam he scored like one basket he's like look at the club you showed me before this"}
{"prompt": "it's interesting because it does seem like sports is like the most accepted thing here but you you dedicated yourself to something completely different and uh did you mind at all that feeling of like everyone being like what are you doing", "completion": "double double highlight"}
{"prompt": "yeah one thing you said to us yesterday you sat and like kind of roasted some of our our content our videos and it was like so informational and educational for us and it's not stuff that you haven't told us before but being around it is so important right sitting in your meetings and understanding how important was that for you to develop a community online of a fan of friends like yeah", "completion": "of course i mean you just it's weird i think the problem is like if you i've told this story years ago probably would have helped it's so much more acceptable now like yeah everyone wants to be a youtuber everyone wants to be a tick-tock or like a growing up now like you can just tell by the people and and the numbers and explosion of social media that like it's a lot more widely accepted and also it might also be where i grew up in north carolina it's different than la but back then like it really just was a strange thing you know what i mean to like want to dedicate your life to being a youtuber and being that obsessed and so for me like there's probably like zero people within a one one-hour radius of me that actually loved youtube like i did and anything like that so it's just like if you wake up and every day you obsess over something and you live and breathe and that's what you think about that's what you do that's what you study on and off that's what you stay up every night grinding and no one else even gives a flying about it it's like you just feel like a weirdo you know like an outcast and and i was also like just dumb back then i didn't realize oh well i just need to find different people i thought like oh my whole life i'll just never enjoy talking to people yeah and then i met other youtubers and then i started talking to them like 10 hours a day and like then that's when the channel really started taking off"}
{"prompt": "you still talk to some of those people", "completion": "that's just where you just so like imagine a world where it's just you working solo and you work 12 hours a day every day for like a year and you're just grinding you make a mistake you learn from it you grind you mistake you learn from it and you do that for like a year and then imagine a different world where you have four friends who are also equally grinding in something similar friend number one makes a mistake on friday he teaches the other four people friend number two makes a mistake the next week teaches everyone and then like you're all learning from each other's mistakes you're all constantly studying 24/7 and downloading each other like after a year you're like two years ahead of the guy who was just solo it really does make a difference especially like my friend group when i was like i met a bunch of people and i had 10,000 subscribers and we all like we agreed not to drink we didn't do drugs like we didn't date we didn't do anything we just literally obsessed from the time we woke up to the time we went to bed that's literally all we did it it's wild like i've told this story before but for people who didn't listen to our other podcasts like one day i literally got up and we had an 18-hour skype call and then i went to bed and that's all i did and we were just tearing apart youtube videos studying trends and stuff like that i don't even know how i got food like pretty sure i was just ordering food so i didn't have to leave my house so we could keep working like it was that level obsession it was just dumb it was so unhealthy"}
{"prompt": "wow are any of them here in person with you now", "completion": "oh i talked to all of them well not all i talked to most of them"}
{"prompt": "yeah i thought about him for the next week after that he's so smart yeah he's super sharp yeah yeah yeah he's really really sharp", "completion": "no no uh one of them his name's dylan um"}
{"prompt": "yeah i think what's interesting is that you know you made all of these friends and you had to skype them right like no one was here with you in person but we were spending time with you yesterday i mean there's people everywhere serious organization not only is there", "completion": "yeah i like him a lot and so he's always been kind of like my sounding board and like if i have a question like i'm like i don't know what to do like he's usually pretty good at helping me think it out like i've probably spent ten thousand hours talking to him over over the course of like the last six years it's wild"}
{"prompt": "personally for me i've had a it's been tough for me to add employees because i have a hard time like giving up control and i don't understand i feel like that's like a really good strength of smears how did you go uh from even just making that decision to hire one person it was", "completion": "yeah that was back when i edited my videos set them all up tore them all down did literally everything all by myself i didn't have like a single employee until like four years ago like"}
{"prompt": "that's every editor's dream is to have someone sit down nightmare", "completion": "it's brutally hard for me man the first one was just an editor and even then it's like because i i so particular and how i wanted it he used i so and i also didn't have office or anything when i first started so i just set up a computer in my room and he would come over and edit the videos after i finished and i would just watch him edit and then i would just be like why'd you cut that why did you cut this"}
{"prompt": "yeah ever almost every podcast i feel like you've been on or every time you talk about youtube you always talk about how you reinvest everything back into the channel literally and i think spending time with you here what i noticed is that's actually not just money it's time yeah you also reinvest all of your time", "completion": "i know i know i know but i was like well like you know every youtuber says it's like no one will ever be able to replicate my style it's i gotta edit it but news flash someone can it's actually not as difficult as you think but back then you know i'm a teenager i didn't understand that at the start it was just a lot of like micromanaging like that um but even then it still freed up so much time because i just kind of got to the point where i was like i can't stand editing i had edited probably like a thousand plus videos in my life at that point between that channel and other things that i'd done i was just like i just don't want to do this i just want to make videos and so that that first one and then i just was like oh why don't i bring like i think i did a video where we like smashed 4 000 plates like dropped them to see how they'd break and it's like well i'm gonna hire just someone to help me pick up these plates and you know hire someone to help with this and and then it just you know i started with like two or three people and then every month i just hire someone else as the videos got bigger and here we are four years later"}
{"prompt": "yeah you invest all of your time into it and i think that's something that is beneficial of being where you are is that you have that ability and then also the concept of hiring is just so that you have more time to invest", "completion": "live and breathe"}
{"prompt": "yeah so we also went to multiple spaces while we were here when did you start filming or when did you get your first space outside of your bedroom", "completion": "exactly right yeah yeah a lot of people like again the thing is everyone has different priorities you know if you want to make a few hundred grand a year and just you know coast or whatever like you know not everyone has ambition and stuff like that but if you really do want to be the best you can possibly be be the biggest youtuber you should look at hiring as a way to free up your time so you can do more important things and even then hyper optimize every little minute and anything that isn't work you should outsource to someone else so you can recharge so you can work again you know"}
{"prompt": "when you're first starting you're saying okay i'm now making x amount of money i can spend x amount of money on my videos", "completion": "oh that's a hard one i mean the videos just kept getting so much bigger i can't tell you which video but um it just the win if you watch my videos when i stopped filming in my room and i started filming outside i it gets so hot here yeah i don't want to just film outside and i burned so easily and so then we got the there's like a an old firefighter this building or whatever like the floor was yellow it was hideous there's two garage doors where the fire trucks used to come in and out that's where we our first ever like studio it's a really small warehouse i started off in my bedroom like we talked about earlier and then i got a little office building like one room basically but it's two rooms they weren't really that big and then we outgrew that in like three months and then and you know my mom told you guys the story yesterday and then i got a bunch more office space like four or five offices and then i got like a little warehouse then i got a bigger warehouse and then i got kind of like a campus like two warehouses because like the videos were getting so big and you have to be you have to work on multiple videos at a time because most of our videos takes months to produce and i don't just upload two or three videos a year so if you're working on like five videos at a time and one of the videos takes up an entire warehouse and another video takes up an entire warehouse well then you can't work on the other three because two warehouses are full so that's what led us to getting this big place because it's so huge we can work on multiple videos here at the same time that just for you youtubers that are wondering like how do you get to this point like it's usually a slow snowball you know"}
{"prompt": "yes", "completion": "i'm saying i made money i spend money"}
{"prompt": "the thing that we not only um realize from talking to you but actually sitting with your mom and and looking them at it yeah so jimmy's sat us down and showed us his finances which was amazing it was so educational but the thing that is", "completion": "all of it yeah forever"}
{"prompt": "so you go from making money spending money to making money losing money", "completion": "i showed him how i lost half a million dollars on a video"}
{"prompt": "so i guess i was going to ask you like when did you get that comfort level of saying i'll actually spend i'm okay with", "completion": "yeah on some videos on something you have to make money for it yeah"}
{"prompt": "was that because the belief was distribution is the most valuable thing", "completion": "the entire time ever since i was 13. i'm even though i wasn't monetized at 13. i know i think i got monetized i was like 15 or 16. but ever since i got my first youtube paycheck i just always spent it back on youtube"}
{"prompt": "what was your relationship to money when you were growing up", "completion": "i just want to be the biggest youtuber i could be i was not like i mean i don't know i'm a dumb 15 year old like all my friends play what is it balloon tower defense class and talk about that i don't know i just was like i want better equipment to make better videos and then and i just want to make better videos then i mean now i'm a lot more strategic but back then it was just like i just want good videos you know"}
{"prompt": "but did you desire money like when you were younger", "completion": "uh i mean it's hard because i don't want to like overplay it you know it's not like i was like wearing where my next meal would come from but we weren't we weren't the most well off like there it was very quickly came to a point where i was making more on like a single brand deal than my mom made an entire year and she was like raising me and my brother and sister and stuff like that um it was"}
{"prompt": "yeah", "completion": "i've always want money so i can make better videos so i can grow my channel yeah but it's like no i mean like dude like the the type of stuff i do now is would have been unfathomable to anyone back when i was younger like so unfathomable it's crazy like if you told me when i was like 15 that one day i'd make 100 grand a year i would have been like what the"}
{"prompt": "yeah the video we talked about yesterday where you lost half a million dollars on that though when when you look at that number does that worry you", "completion": "people make that kind of money right like i thought it was crazy that a youtuber made like 300 grand over the course of a few years you know what i mean like it's like it was it was pretty brutal like you know a few hundred bucks was like out of this world insane back then you know"}
{"prompt": "yeah one thing colin and i were talking about yesterday um after we left we were like this is i think colin mentioned to you that this feels like the modern day movie studio right like we're going into creative meetings we're listening to development we're uh understanding like production problems that you guys are trying to solve you all drove in here yeah this morning and we didn't even we didn't even feel like there was something in here there was a huge truck in here and we were just went about our you know i guess yeah that's normal yeah that's normal here that's fine", "completion": "well no i mean at the end of the day i could spend less per videos if i want to i'm just focused on making the best videos possible period i don't care about making money i don't care about time i don't care about it i just want to make the best videos on the planet but at any point if i was like oh i need to stop losing money i just you know don't spend a million dollars on the next video just spend 100 grand you know what i mean"}
{"prompt": "yeah yeah they came to pick up stuff but it's a it's a modern-day movie studio but you're actually even at spending 200 000 for what you're making for the type of distribution you're getting uh it's actually way less than tv is spending", "completion": "yeah that's funny did they come to get stuff removed"}
{"prompt": "and no one is", "completion": "yeah right i know no it's it's interesting too because if i go to them like hey just for fun you know that's like hey you want to give me some money to produce a tv show like no it's like oh it's like okay i guess i'll just hey i have no interest in doing that type of stuff but uh it's funny because sometimes i poke at them to like see if they'll give me money and uh"}
{"prompt": "i mean part of like seeing all the different spaces was we met all these different teams it felt like there were so many different departments so many different teams that we met and everyone first of all is incredibly nice here everyone has been so nice to us like we feel incredibly taken care of um but outside of that like everyone is such um like you've curated a team of people who are just so hard working it's like all about the work yeah there's no fluff", "completion": "i guess they just don't believe that i can do dope stuff with like a million dollars like even just something as simple as like a million dollars an episode to like just go give away money to people yeah like they'd be like no it's like i spend that for almost my youtube videos at this point and i know it would like kill it for them yeah but i mean at the end i just want to be a youtuber i don't really care to do that type of stuff but you know it's always fun to be like hey netflix how much would you pay me right"}
{"prompt": "so how did you go from hiring one editor to hiring the next person the next person", "completion": "i'm blessed i i agree we got a lot of great people here and obviously you know like the the videos we do where uh now i'm drawing like like selling houses for a dollar yeah from putting a million orbeez in someone's backyard or whatever what the stupid things they're doing or filling a person's house with slime like i can't do that on my own obviously i need help so uh right bless yeah"}
{"prompt": "how do you find people because i think that's something that youtubers have a really hard time with", "completion": "just like it's not like i just woke up one day and i have dozens of employees like it was just like i've literally just been hiring like a person a month for the last four years like you know it's the the videos it's like because it's also not like you know i gave a homeless guy 10 grand and then you know the next day i'm buying everything in five stores you know and needing a hundred people to fill dozens of u-hauls and stuff like it was just a slow progression up and along the way we just pick up a person and another person another and"}
{"prompt": "yeah", "completion": "i don't really know i mean i've been doing like i said four years like"}
{"prompt": "yeah i l i personally loved the creative meetings i thought those were the most interesting to be in just the way you guys are thinking and the way like everything has to fit together and you're thinking obviously very much in in like terms of retention but your whole team is also thinking the exact same as you should yeah and like the problem solving you guys are doing is so specific to um right you know what i mean like it's not it's not problem-solving that if you walked into a movie studio that they're thinking about and i think actually that's some of the problem with what's happening in hollywood is that they're thinking about the fact that something on netflix is competing with one of your videos do you know what i mean like when i'm on i'm watching an internet video whether it's netflix or youtube like you're on the same playing field so", "completion": "it's a very very very slow grind hiring all these people uh i honestly there are way more qualified people for that uh if someone knows how to find great talent please reach out to me i'll pay you"}
{"prompt": "you actually have to compete in the same", "completion": "yeah"}
{"prompt": "yeah yeah yeah i think the thing is though netflix sure cares about retention but they're grabbing content from all over from people who aren't basing all of their data and analytics off 10 years of just uploading to netflix right right and that's what's entirely different about creating for youtube is that you're taking the metrics from one place and have been for the last decade or more", "completion": "well i'm sure they shoot for retention as well we're just we're very very serious about it though i don't like using cinematic shots or you know unless like you have multiple cam setups here like if i'm talking to this camera and you're not cutting it for too long that's boring you'll lose retention but if i talk and you cut to that angle while i'm talking and come back and you know it helps it and it's not bad to be obsessed like if people aren't cleaning up that means they're entertained you know so i'm hyper obsessed with just making sure people actually like what they're watching"}
{"prompt": "after we uh hung out yesterday i went back and watched the fbi video again and i watched the first 40 seconds and i was sitting with colin showing him like a lot of what we talked about i was seeing in the first 40 seconds and i was like you really do all those things and those first 40 seconds were so jam-packed and you introduced so many new things like so much new stuff between both the visuals too i mean even the the concept that you say in the first 40 seconds first of all the visuals are already changing but you also say there's an nfl stadium there's a private jet there's a maze", "completion": "which is it just gets op when you just do it and and you just study year after year after year after year and you learn from every mistake and you have other people doing it and you're teaching each other and like like if you want to be a youtuber if you're watching this right like and you're thinking in the scale of 10 years like if you literally are grinding and you're obsessed and you're just every day studying and and learning you surround yourself with smart people and you just work like hell to be honest for 10 years like there's probably a good chance you'll make it but if you do that over the course six months or a year i don't know you know um but that's why i like i like to think over the span of a decade a lot of people are very short-term sided but you know as long as you're innovating adapting reinvesting i think if you do it intelligently like you have a good odds of i don't know like killing it you know"}
{"prompt": "how much time do you spend on those openings", "completion": "this is why you should watch the video yeah see these things yeah yeah and like the thing people undervalue the most is literally the first 10 seconds of the video like yeah i can almost i think i can quote it uh i tied up an fbi agent i have a hundred thousand dollars in this bag here's a knife good luck and i just run away like it gives you everything you need yeah no wasted words short concise and then tension"}
{"prompt": "yeah you had a video of ours that you said you were interested in the thumbnail you clicked on it and you were bored after five seconds", "completion": "i'm a perfectionist i i really it's so important like that's your uh first impression for everyone clicking on the video so like i like the whole time leading up to that i'm just constantly obsessed with mostly the first minute just like making sure like if i were to click on this video i would like the first minute and that it would hook me yeah i mean"}
{"prompt": "yeah and yeah that was really eye opening for us and we now you recognize like i think a lot of times you you talk about obsessing over the content and really getting into it and i think sometimes it's hard to understand what that exactly means and then when you said that i was like oh that's what it means it literally means that there's a there was a big problem and you predicted that about 40 of the people left yeah in 10 seconds it was exactly 40", "completion": "i can tell you it was the one about the hype house yeah why everyone's leaving the house yeah and i showed them on my phone yeah i was like i the title and thumbnail made me tap and the red bar was like so tiny you could barely see it cause i clicked off in eight seconds i was like this is me and my house four days ago before you came down clearly you just didn't grab me"}
{"prompt": "yeah and i think that that is what i was going to bring out", "completion": "i could tell yeah and and i i told them the remedy for this is they need better friends 100 no no offense to people that are their friends i know that they like you but the fact that no one's like calling you up after you're uploading that and just roasting the hell out of it and going like dude this isn't the best you could do like and it's not uh a knock on you guys it's actually them like someone should say like hey you guys are too smart for this like you're better than this you can make a video better than this which is what you should do"}
{"prompt": "you can also dm yes if you're a friend and you're watching that's on youtube that's not on us", "completion": "if you have their phone number call them and say that call us right now you watch a video and it's not i don't want to swear too much freaking perfect call them and say hey this is garbage here's why fix it"}
{"prompt": "something you told us yesterday is that we need to have a checklist of all the things that need to be checked off", "completion": "like even like my fbi video like you know my team is working on that for months and i'm whatever we probably spent over half a million dollars between everything and i uploaded i'm like this is like a perfect video it's so good we're so perfected and then you know i have like two or three people that call me they just on it and i'm like oh that kind of hurt my feelings i'm like but he's right you know like this part was a little fake this scene was a little drawn out could have done this a little bit better um and it's like that's what you need no matter you there's no such thing as a perfect video like someone should always call you and get on your video because it could be better like that's because imagine if someone does that every video and you upload hundreds if not a thousand videos over the next 10 years and every single time someone's critiquing you and you're applying what they're critiquing like imagine the compound effect over that time span it's it's invaluable but if you upload 100 videos and very few people are sitting on them then like you just lost so much compound effect"}
{"prompt": "yeah we talked about that today because one thing that we realized was everyone on your team also is holding you accountable for some of those checklist items and that's when we're like oh we need our team to hold us accountable", "completion": "because i talk to him quite frequently that's true and every time i give him the same advice and he'll apply some of it and then he'll like revert back and i'm like god dang it put it on the checklist so i can tell you the things to do and then going forward just check them off before you upload a video so you too"}
{"prompt": "that was the thing that i think i was so excited about in those creative meetings was everyone was on the same page like it wasn't just like hey whatever jimmy says exactly and i thought that was really cool", "completion": "because sometimes i'm like no that doesn't actually matter like that would be an extra two hours of work yeah and they're like yeah that would help retention yeah they're like who the are you wait you don't want the perfect video i'm like you're right you're right let's do it"}
{"prompt": "yeah when you first started hiring people it sounds like you hired people for the execution right like i filmed a video i needed edited so i can move on to the next thing", "completion": "because i'm not an omnipotent being like i need pushback you need people to like there are people with better ideas than me you know like one of the op things about hiring people is like you know if you're editing a video you can probably only devote 20 of your time to it or whatever 30 40 if someone else is editing it and that's their job they can dedicate hundred percent of their their work time to it right so since they have three times the amount of time to edit that video they should be able to edit it better than you even if it's only 20 better because they have more time same with like thinking creatively or like building sets or doing anything like you you have like as youtubers especially people who build side businesses and have side channels there's like 50 things that need to be done and if you split your time amongst it they're all only getting a few percentage of your time so like someone should be able to do that job better than you because they're giving it a hundred percent of their time and that's like the op part about hiring people which is obvious you know"}
{"prompt": "but i need like i need this to move from here to here yeah", "completion": "yeah well that or and then i was like i don't like moving boxes sure yeah i'd rather"}
{"prompt": "when did you then start hiring people for to look forward to other videos right so not just stuff that you've shot and needs to get done or production", "completion": "like one of our first people is literally just like he just did chrome work he would just move boxes he was happy pick a box move it or i need this thing or whatever yeah"}
{"prompt": "how far in advance are you planning", "completion": "slow progression i mean yeah because i'm i'm sure like uh just three years ago we probably like came up with what we were gonna film like the week before yeah like yeah like planning months ahead and like working on because you know like if i'm burying myself alive i can't do that next week right or i could now because i've done it but but when we first came up with the idea like that's something that takes like 100 days like you gotta build the coffin you gotta bury it for ten days to make sure it works you gotta you know figure out how to get air into it and the medic and all that type of stuff then make the area look nice so it's pretty on film and figure out lighting da da so um it's just like the videos just slowly got more more complex and obviously i just had to bring people on to figure it out"}
{"prompt": "yesterday though we went to three creative meetings back to back yeah about three videos that are pretty much immediately in production yeah", "completion": "i do know tariq just how far out is the calendar isn't it three months yeah right now it's not too far out three to four months so"}
{"prompt": "that one it sounds crazy but yeah from the creative meeting", "completion": "right we're gonna spend or i'm gonna spend 100 hours alone on island it might change i might push the output as right now"}
{"prompt": "it's uh the escape room oh yeah", "completion": "and then uh a different video for half a million dollars so i don't want to spoil and what was the third one we talked about"}
{"prompt": "and that one that's the one specifically where we were like oh because it's the world's hardest escape room each room is part of the story so each room needs to be custom built exactly based on retention", "completion": "and then i'm gonna attempt the world's hardest escape room yeah"}
{"prompt": "when it comes to retention obviously there's things you can do in the first 30 seconds the first minute are there checklist items you have to get people to 10 minutes to 15 to 20.", "completion": "we scouted all the best escape rooms they're pretty terrible so we just decided build our own so we can make it epic um and obviously since i'm building i'm not the one doing it but uh it if when you guys see the video it's well you guys know but it's a pretty cool twist"}
{"prompt": "so that like introducing other narratives uh well", "completion": "yeah i mean it's very hard with a single storyline if you're doing like a double digit minute video to just have that one thing drip their entire attention throughout the whole video and pay off at the end um so typically if you're doing a longer video you should introduce like a side story and like re you should have some plan halfway through like to re-engage them so they don't just get bored you know i mean like if i just said like if i handed you a camera i had a camera i was like okay if he tags me he gets 100 grand and then i just run and that's it it's just me running through the woods and him just running through the woods after me you can't make a 15 minute video out of it you know what i mean but if i do that and then like three minutes in i pull a lever and a bear comes out and starts chasing him and he has to get away from the bear i don't know obviously we wouldn't do this but kill the bear and then he starts chasing me and then six minutes in i jump across the lake and as he goes to jump through i press a button that shoots him to the moon whatever you know what i mean like now the sudden it's interesting and you're watching right and that's it right one it's just a single story and it's boring the other has side stories that like re-engage people"}
{"prompt": "well i don't even want to pull up our attention yeah", "completion": "actually yeah you know how we were talking about dylan earlier yeah he just said i'm getting close to 70 percent i'm almost a decent youtuber and he sent me a graph wow or his new video had uh 65 retention oh wow i told him if he doesn't get 70 retention on a video then he didn't do something right"}
{"prompt": "we're probably at like 40 percent right now so we got some more we were talking about here a lot of times in our videos we'll be like this video is about this this this and that and we were like well what if we actually held one back and at that four or five or six minute part we're like and the one thing we didn't tell you yeah was this yeah and then also it like takes another direction but i also think the thing you said that i think is important is that it's not always just a bear that you have to bring in as a dual narrative right it also could be like you mentioned the visuals right in a lot of our videos we have like really fast moving visuals custom animations that's what makes it interesting exactly like if you're not a creator who's doing maybe bigger stunts or anything like that and you are explaining things", "completion": "70 that's what you need if it's below that figure out how to get higher"}
{"prompt": "or in the case that we were talking about some of these shorts creators are gaining massive viewership by making subway sandwiches or making ice cream and telling stuff shut up and dylan lemay they're they're like i mean 82 million views making ice cream and telling a story yeah so it's like there you go that's visual it's interesting and there's another narrative where he's telling a different story about", "completion": "your visuals can be as simple as an ant crawling on your skin and biting you yeah like it doesn't have to be right"}
