The following is a speech from Andrew Tate about how to make money:
there are four main ways to gain money
you either trade your time for money
you trade information for money
you give a product or service for money
or you put something to work for money
I'll say that again we're gonna go
through them one by one these are the
main ways that money will arrive in your
bank account remember what I just told
you guys the four main things about cash
how it works How You Gonna attack it
identify where it's moving Etc these are
the four main ways money is made
first
is
time for money now this is what most
jobs are and there's nothing wrong with
the job a lot of people are going to
come and say quit your job no there's
nothing wrong with having a job and it's
better than doing nothing but this is
the first level
this is the first level on how to make
money so what you do when you have a job
is you give up your time
to get some cash so a guy will say if
you stand here all day I'll give you x
amount of money and you agree you give
up your time to make money the problem
with giving up your time to make money
is what who knows the problem of giving
up your time to make money
