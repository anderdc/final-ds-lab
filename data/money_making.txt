there are four main ways to gain money
you either trade your time for money
you treat information for money
you give a product or service for money
or you put something to work for money
I'll say that again we're gonna go
through them one by one these are the
main ways that money will arrive in your
bank account remember what I just told
you guys the four main things about cash
how it works How You Gonna attack it
identify where it's moving Etc these are
the four main ways money is made
first
is
time for money now this is what most
jobs are and there's nothing wrong with
the job a lot of people are going to
come and say quit your job no there's
nothing wrong with having a job and it's
better than doing nothing but this is
the first level
this is the first level on how to make
money so what you do when you have a job
is you give up your time
to get some cash so a guy will say if
you stand here all day I'll give you x
amount of money and you agree you give
up your time to make money the problem
with giving up your time to make money
is what who knows the problem of giving
up your time to make money
I'll tell you the problem
the problem is you only have a certain
amount of time
it's very difficult to get rich if you
give up your time for money because you
have a certain amount of time you need
to sleep you need to eat you got other
stuff to do you haven't got the time to
sit there and get rich that way
so time for money is great and obviously
the more valuable your time is the
better that's fine you can make more but
you still have a finite amount of time
and this is the problem with trading
your time for money
next is information for money
now the good thing about getting
information for money
is that your time is not explicitly
linked
so if you do something like a video
giving information that one video you
can film at one time but it can be given
out or sold a million times and you get
paid every single time
but your time is no longer linked to the
money
so a lot of people make money purely on
information
and this it could be done lots of ways
it can be done with what I'm doing right
now I'm making money based on what I
know right now I am selling information
to you people I know information and I'm
provided there are also high level
Consultants do the same thing
information is valuable we live in the
age of information
another thing I guys want you to write
down your notes some of the two most
important things in the world today are
information and attention if you can get
if you have information
and you can get attention you will be
rich
because if you can get attention people
are going to pay attention to you and if
you have information to give them you're
going to be rich
this webinar is an example of how me a
person who can attract attention who has
information can make money so
information for money is better than
time for money now every single person
sitting here there must be something you
know
you know something you know something
others don't know it doesn't matter if
it's how to play guitar doesn't matter
is how to play piano it doesn't matter
if it's how to fix a car doesn't matter
what it is you must have some
information that other people find
useful
that information can be weaponized and
it can be turned into money we're going
to get into how to do that later but
it's not actually very complicated you
need to Garner attention
you need to produce uh the videos or the
subject material or the the PDFs or
whatever you want to do explain to
people what you know you need to
establish credibility
so they understand that they can trust
you and they will pay for your
information
this is another way to get money
information so keep that in mind write
that down because when you write down
your piece of paper information you also
need to sit and think what do I know
that other people don't know
so there must be something you know and
that information is valuable you have to
convince people it's valuable and to
come and buy it from you
next
this is what most businesses do they
provide a product or a service for money
now this is different from information
because even though if you provide a
service you have information let's say
you fix cars you know how to fix cars
you have that information but you're not
selling the information you're selling
the service which is different the
information would be selling me a book
on how to fix my own car the service is
coming here and to fix it for me so a
product or service selling for money
this is very very simple that's what
most businesses do they buy they get a
product or service and they sell it for
a markup now this is actually this is
the way that most Mega businesses make
money but in the modern world it's quite
difficult to do and it's difficult to do
because most products and services are
monopolized they're monopolized because
everyone's already selling everything
and we live in a global economy now and
there's no product you can think of that
I can't go to amazon.com and find
cheaper from China and they'll sell it
at a one penny maybe two Penny markup so
the product
route is getting harder unless you're
very very unique and you build a brand
which is something we're going to get
into
the service is fine but you know what
the problem with service is service is
once again linked to your time if you're
providing a service you're still giving
up your time for money
do you understand so the product angle
is difficult the service angle is
difficult the time angle is difficult so
far the only angle we have will allow
you to make money scalable out and
Beyond is information for money
next
putting something else to do the work
for you now this is what corporations
and the mega rich people do they either
get people to work for them or they get
their money to work for them so to keep
their time free they make other people
or other things give up their time so a
company will come along let's look at
the slides a company will come along
with a service it will advertise its
service it will then hire people number
one it will get people to work for them
and then those people will give up
their time
in exchange for a wage give up their
time for for a wage and the company will
keep money
so the owner of that company although he
has to manage things his time is not
explicitly linked to income
now the super wealthy with the super
wealthy people do is they get their
money to work for them and if your money
works for you it's even better than
people because people need to be managed
a lot more than money your money doesn't
need to be managed money just works so
if you have millions of dollars and you
put them in a 10 you can get a 10 return
or even a three percent return
you're going to be rich on the interest
without doing anything
so making your money make your money is
great but you could only live off this
money if you already have a lot of money
so let's go back through and analyze
getting people to work for you is
complicated setup because you actually
need to sell a product or service to get
most people to work with you also you
need to people manage so for a long mere
period of time you're not going to have
your time free this is the first thing
second thing getting your money to work
for you you need a lot of money to live
off the work your money does you need a
lot of money to get this to happen most
people don't have enough money to put
their money to work to live off it now
you still should put your money to work
I want to talk about that but you can't
live off your money working
prior to service for money we've
discussed already your time is going to
be linked to it it's extremely difficult
to sell products nowadays unless you're
very very strong with your branding or
you find something very unique and
services is once going to be linked it's
once again going to be linked to your
time
back again
time for money it's finite so once again
it's difficult so of the four main ways
to make money the best way to make money
is information for money so information
for money is your best bet at making
money especially online
because people go to the Internet for
information people Google things all day
people are sitting there all day trying
to get information and there is plenty
of free information but still you will
be amazed if you can establish
credibility and you can get attention
how you can get people to not want the
free information they want the
information from you
so let's imagine you play guitar you're
a guitar player if I were to Google how
to play guitar I'm sure there would be
endless free information telling me how
to play guitar
but if I see you playing guitar and the
way you play is really cool and your
social media is really busy and you get
lots of attention and you tell me that
you're going to teach me how to play
guitar for the low low fee of 100 bucks
I don't want to learn guitar from anyone
I want to learn from you I don't want
the free guitar I want to know what you
know because you have credibility and
you have attention so don't worry that
the information you know is already free
on the internet don't worry about that
you need to worry about establishing
credibility and attention and
information for money is the easiest way
now I'm not saying you can't make money
the other ways
but I'm still saying that that is your
best bet at making money and you're
instantly online now
the correct thing to do is to do all of
them
if you want to start if you're starting
at the very very bottom you need to be
doing everything to make money because
what is the end goal the end goal is to
be like me where number two
getting pet you're getting your money to
work for you I have enough money now
that I could take my money give my money
a job and do nothing
I ain't gonna talk to nobody I ain't
gonna do nothing
but to get there you need a lot of money
so that is the end goal getting your
money to work for you so until you get
there you need to be doing everything
so you should not be wasting time if you
have spare time you should be trading
that time
for money
a lot of people finish their job like oh
I finished my job now I can relax
if you want to relax fine if you want to
be rich you ain't got time for the Rocks
you've got to find something to do with
your time that will make you more money
if you have spare time you should be
trading it for money
